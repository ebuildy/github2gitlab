Import Github project to Gitlab Gitlab has a native plugin to import a Github repository, but itâ€™s very basic. I wrote a real script that import every things from Github to Gitlab:

[] Members
[] Members email
[] Teams ==> Gitlab groups
[] Labels
[] Milestones
[] Projects
[] Issues
[] Issues comments
[] Issues date
[] Pull Request ==> Gitlab merge request
